## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### üéâ **Initial Release - Production Ready Quality Platform**

This marks the completion of **Phase 1** (Foundation) and **Phase 2** (Backend API & Authentication) of the Quality Platform project.

### ‚ú® **Added**

#### **Foundation & Infrastructure**
- Nx workspace monorepo structure with pnpm package manager
- GitFlow workflow with main/develop branch strategy
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated quality checks
- ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Conventional commits with Husky pre-commit hooks
- VS Code workspace settings and development environment configuration

#### **Backend API (NestJS)**
- Complete NestJS application with TypeScript
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with interactive UI at `/api/docs`
- Global validation pipeline using class-validator
- CORS configuration for development and production environments
- Global API prefix (`/api`) for clean URL structure
- Environment-based configuration with `@nestjs/config`

#### **Authentication System**
- JWT-based authentication with Passport.js
- Local strategy for email/password authentication
- JWT strategy for protected route access
- User registration endpoint with comprehensive validation
- User login endpoint with secure credential verification
- Protected user profile endpoint (`/api/auth/me`)
- Password hashing with bcryptjs (12 salt rounds)
- Role-based access control (USER/ADMIN roles)

#### **Database Integration**
- Prisma ORM with SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production) support
- Complete e-commerce database schema with relationships:
  - **User model**: Authentication and profile management
  - **Product model**: E-commerce product catalog
  - **Order model**: Order processing with status workflow
  - **OrderItem model**: Junction table for order-product relationships
- Database migrations with Prisma migrate
- Database health checks with connection testing

#### **Health Monitoring**
- Three-tier health check system for production deployment:
  - **Basic health** (`/api/health`): System status and uptime
  - **Readiness probe** (`/api/health/ready`): Database connectivity and dependencies
  - **Liveness probe** (`/api/health/live`): Process health and memory monitoring
- Kubernetes-ready health endpoints for container orchestration

#### **Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Complete API documentation** with practical examples and integration guides
- **Database schema documentation** with relationships and query examples  
- **API architecture guide** covering NestJS patterns and security
- **Development setup guide** for new developer onboarding
- **Production deployment guide** with Docker, Cloud, and Kubernetes options
- **Technology decision log** with ADR-style architectural decisions
- Updated project README with actual implemented technology stack

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technology Stack**
- **Monorepo**: Nx Workspace with pnpm
- **Backend**: NestJS with OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport.js (Local + JWT strategies)
- **Validation**: class-validator with comprehensive DTOs
- **Security**: bcryptjs password hashing, authentication guards
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Testing**: Jest and Supertest framework ready (tests to be implemented)

### üìä **API Endpoints**

#### **Core Endpoints**
- `GET /api` - API welcome message with version info
- `GET /api/docs` - Interactive Swagger documentation

#### **Health & Monitoring**
- `GET /api/health` - Basic health check with system info
- `GET /api/health/ready` - Readiness probe (includes database connectivity)
- `GET /api/health/live` - Liveness probe for Kubernetes

#### **Authentication System**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with validation
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with JWT token generation
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile (requires JWT)
