# Quality Platform Documentation

Welcome to the Quality Platform documentation. This directory contains comprehensive guides, references, and tutorials for the platform.

## üß† Context Management System

**New!** The Quality Platform includes an advanced context management system that provides automatic and manual access to project information.

### Quick Start
- **[Quick Reference](context-quick-reference.md)** - Essential commands and troubleshooting
- **[Usage Guide](context-usage-guide.md)** - When to use automatic vs manual context
- **[Complete Documentation](context-management.md)** - Full system architecture and integration

### Automatic Context Features
- üöÄ Development server startup integration (`pnpm dev`)
- üîí Pre-commit hook validation and guidance
- üõ†Ô∏è CLI tools integration for quality analysis

### Manual Context Commands
```bash
# Quick access via package scripts
pnpm context:summary              # Complete project overview
pnpm context:feature api          # Feature-specific guidance
pnpm context:git                  # Git status and branch info

# Advanced CLI framework commands
pnpm quality:check context validate    # System health check
```

## üí° Quick Tips

1. **Start with context** - Use `pnpm dev` for automatic context or `pnpm context:summary` for manual overview
2. **Validate setup** - Run `pnpm quality:check context validate` to ensure everything works
3. **Follow GitFlow** - Check [Context Management](context-management.md) for branch naming and workflows
4. **Test everything** - See [Testing Guide](TESTING_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive testing approaches

## üìñ Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to documentation:

1. **Use context system** - Run `pnpm context:feature <area>` to understand the area you're documenting
2. **Follow patterns** - Check existing docs for structure and style
3. **Link related content** - Connect new docs with existing guides
4. **Test examples** - Ensure all code examples work with current setup
5. **Update index** - Add new docs to relevant sections in this README
