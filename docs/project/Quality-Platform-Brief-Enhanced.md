# Functional & Technical Brief — "Quality Platform" Monorepo

## Part I: Functional Brief

### 1) Vision & Purpose
**Vision.** Maintain a single repository that serves as a reusable **quality platform** to:
- Accelerate new projects with good practices from day one.
- Train and mentor teams in modern QA/QE approaches.
- Practice and demonstrate concepts aligned with **ISTQB** and continuous quality (before and after release).

**Value proposition.** Standardize quality (processes, criteria, examples, and templates) to reduce failures, **shorten delivery time**, and increase **confidence** in every release.

---

### 2) Problems This Monorepo Solves
- Slow project onboarding due to lack of a quality baseline and clear criteria.
- Fragile tests, duplicated efforts, and unreliable outcomes.
- Lack of business-readable metrics to decide when something is "ready."
- Difficulty teaching or assessing QA/QE practices in a hands-on way.

---

### 3) Users & Usage Scenarios
- **Antonio (QE Lead / Mentor).** Uses the monorepo to train, standardize, audit, and improve.
- **Developers.** Use it as a "golden path" (ready-to-apply good practices).
- **Other QA/QE.** Learn techniques and apply them to their real product.
- **Non-technical stakeholders.** Consult concise summaries, acceptance criteria, and understandable metrics.

**Typical scenarios.**
1. **Project onboarding:** use the monorepo as a starter to begin with quality from day one.
2. **Training/mentoring:** guided exercises and examples that explain the "why."
3. **Continuous improvement:** measure, spot bottlenecks, and prioritize quality improvements with impact.
4. **ISTQB support:** practice material and mapping to syllabi (Foundation, Agile, TAE, Advanced).

---

### 4) Scope (What It Includes)
- **Simple "sample product" module** (web + service) to demonstrate realistic business flows.
- **Example tests at different levels** (unit/integration/acceptance) explained in business language.
- **Functional contracts** (what a service "promises" and why) and compatibility rules among teams.
- **Test data management** (which data, for which scenarios, and expected behavior across flows).
- **Business-oriented quality criteria** (see §7).
- **Functional templates:** 1‑page quality strategy, risk matrix, exit checklist, review guides.

> Note: The **technical how** (frameworks, ports, tools) is detailed in Part II.

---

### 5) Out of Scope (for now)
- Complex, real external integrations.
- "Exhaustive" test coverage. We prioritize **critical flows** and representative examples.
- Low-level optimization. Pedagogical **clarity** matters more than squeezing performance.

---

### 6) What I Expect from Claude Code
Claude should act as a **functional facilitator** and **product coach**. When proposing tasks or changes, Claude should:

1) **Justify value** in business terms:  
   - What risk does it reduce? What decision does it enable? Which metric does it improve?

2) **Write objectives and acceptance criteria in business language.** For example:  
   - *Objective:* "Increase confidence in the delivery of capability X."  
   - *Acceptance criteria (functional):*  
     - "A user can complete flow X in fewer than N steps."  
     - "If step Y fails, the system shows a clear and recoverable message."  
     - "Verification Z prevents releasing changes that break compatibility for consumers."

3) **Propose clear, lightweight deliverables:**  
   - 1‑page strategy, exit checklist, executive summary, risk log with impact/probability, brief results note.

4) **Prioritize by impact and risk** (not by technology):  
   - First, items that **prevent escapes** and **shorten delivery time**.  
   - Call out dependencies and realistic estimates.

5) **Always offer a Minimum Viable Deliverable (MVD)** for any requested functional artifact, plus a path for incremental improvement.

---

### 7) Quality Criteria (Non-technical)
- **Usefulness & fitness for purpose:** examples and artifacts should solve real problems for a product team.
- **Clarity & traceability:** each artifact (strategy, matrix, checklist) must state **why it exists** and **how to use it**.
- **Robustness of critical flows:** prioritize that **key paths** work well (clear messages, coherent states).
- **Functional compatibility:** changes impacting other teams must be announced and accompanied by safeguards.
- **Reliable test data:** scenarios and data must be **reproducible** and **explainable** (expected/actual and why).
- **Functional observability:** it must be possible to **know what's going on** in a flow through visible signals.
- **Accessibility & privacy as ethical minimums:** people can use it; data handling respects basic norms.

---

### 8) Success Metrics (Business-readable)
- **Escaped defects** (decrease).  
- **Cycle time from "ready to test" to "ready to release"** (decrease).  
- **Perceived reliability** of critical flows (increase), validated through simple checks after each delivery.  
- **Rate of "changes rejected due to breaking others"** (decrease), thanks to contracts and pre-verification.  
- **Internal adoption** of the monorepo: number of teams/people using it and % of templates utilized.

---

### 9) Expected Workflow with Claude
1. **Functional brief:** Antonio describes the goal (e.g., "We want to ensure the order creation flow is reliable.")  
2. **Claude's proposal (max 1–2 pages):**  
   - Objective, value, risks, acceptance criteria, deliverables.  
3. **Work plan with tasks:**  
   - 5–10 tasks max, with dependencies and rough durations.  
4. **Incremental execution:**  
   - Minimum deliverable (demo + notes).  
5. **Closure & learning:**  
   - Executive summary (what was achieved, what's pending, next step).

---

### 10) Governance & Cadence
- **Sprint rhythm** with a concrete objective and visible deliverables.  
- **Short reviews** using a **functional checklist**.  
- **Lightweight evidence:** a capture/table/brief note per deliverable, no lengthy reports.

---

### 11) Functional Roadmap (High-level)
- **Sprint 1:** Monorepo functional base + 1‑page quality strategy.  
- **Sprint 2:** Exit criteria and pre‑release verification (gates) written in business language.  
- **Sprints 3–4:** Test design techniques with functional examples; test data catalog.  
- **Sprint 5:** Functional observability: how to tell a flow is healthy without reading code.  
- **Sprint 6:** Business‑readable performance checks: reasonable times per critical flow.  
- **Sprints 7–8:** Working in Agile: quality planning per story/epic, risk‑based priorities.  
- **Sprints 9–10:** "Automation with purpose": what to automate first and why (not by trend).  
- **Sprint 11:** Safe post‑deploy validation: checks, plan B, and clear rollback criteria.  
- **Sprint 12:** Case study with metrics, lessons learned, and adoption guide for other teams.

---

### 12) Initial Backlog Lines (Functional)
- **Strategy & Governance:** one‑pager strategy, definitions of "ready to test" and "ready to release," checklists.  
- **Risk & Prioritization:** risk matrix per flow, criteria to decide what to test first.  
- **Compatibility & Contracts:** rules for team coexistence, change announcements, compatibility windows.  
- **Test Data:** minimal catalog (what data, for which cases, success/failure signals).  
- **Functional Observability:** "what business should see" to validate a flow (without techniques).  
- **Readable Performance:** target times per flow (e.g., completion in <N seconds "under normal conditions").  
- **Accessibility & Messaging:** helpful error messages, reasonable limits, dignified error handling.

---

### 13) Deliverable Templates (Summary)
- **1‑page Quality Strategy:** 3 objectives, top‑3 risks, metrics, weekly plan, owners.  
- **Risk Matrix (brief table):** risk, probability, impact, mitigation, owner.  
- **Exit Checklist:** the essentials that must be okay before a release.  
- **Executive Summary:** goal, what was done, simple evidence, next steps.  
- **Story‑level Test Guide:** business goal, risks, representative cases, data, success criteria.

---

### 14) Rules for Task Generation
- **Simple format:** *Title (verb + outcome), Description (business value), Acceptance Criteria (3–5 bullets), Dependencies, Priority.*  
- **Business language**, not technical. Avoid library names unless essential.  
- **Outcome‑driven:** each task yields a small, clear piece of evidence (screenshot, checklist, brief note).  
- **Size limits:** tasks of 1–4 hours; split if longer.  
- **Order by risk/impact:** prioritize items that prevent user or cross‑team problems.

**Task example (model):**  
- **Title:** Define exit criteria for "Order search."  
- **Description:** Agree on what is essential to consider this ready for users.  
- **Acceptance criteria:**  
  1) A list of 6–8 criteria in clear language (messages, times, limits, compatibility).  
  2) Validated by at least 1 dev and 1 business stakeholder.  
  3) Checklist published in the guides folder.  
- **Dependencies:** None.  
- **Priority:** High.

---

### 15) Risks & Assumptions
- **Risk:** turning the monorepo into a "too technical" project.  
  - *Mitigation:* keep functional artifacts and business summaries.  
- **Risk:** too many examples, little adoption.  
  - *Mitigation:* prioritize what a team would **use tomorrow**.  
- **Assumption:** at least one review and availability to validate criteria.

---

### 16) Glossary (Concise & Functional)
- **Monorepo:** one repository with several related modules to speed up work and maintain coherence.  
- **Contract:** a clear agreement about what a service "promises" to deliver to others, in understandable language.  
- **Exit criteria:** the minimal list of conditions that must hold to release a change.  
- **Functional observability:** visible signals that reveal whether a critical flow is healthy or degraded.  
- **Critical flow:** a usage path that, if broken, directly impacts business or users.
