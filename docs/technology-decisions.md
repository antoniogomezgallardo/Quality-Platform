## ADR-001: Monorepo Architecture with Nx

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: Active  
**Context**: Need to manage multiple related applications (API, web frontend, shared libraries) in a single repository while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

**Decision**: Use Nx Workspace for monorepo management with pnpm as the package manager.

**Rationale**:

- **CI/CD Efficiency**: Build only what's changed with Nx's affected command system

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Turborepo: Similar benefits but Nx provides better NestJS integration and affected builds
- Separate repositories: Would require complex dependency management and synchronization

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simplified development workflow
- ✅ Better code reuse and consistency
- ✅ Faster CI/CD with incremental builds
- ⚠️ Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Nx
- ⚠️ Larger repository size

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session-based authentication: Requires session storage and doesn't scale as well
- OAuth only: More complex setup and dependency on external providers
- Custom auth: Higher security risk and more maintenance overhead

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Excellent scalability and performance
- ✅ Works well with modern frontend frameworks
- ✅ No server-side session management needed
- ✅ Industry standard security practices
- ⚠️ Token refresh complexity for long-lived sessions
- ⚠️ Token storage security concerns on client side

**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Industry standard for password hashing with built-in salting
- **Performance**: Good balance between security and performance (12 rounds)
- **JavaScript Native**: Pure JavaScript implementation, no native dependencies
- **Proven**: Battle-tested library with wide adoption
- **Future Proof**: Configurable work factor allows increasing security over time

**Alternatives Considered**:
- bcrypt (native): Faster but requires native compilation, deployment complexity

**Rationale**:
- **Stable Releases**: Main branch always contains production-ready code
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
- **Code Review Process**: All changes go through pull requests to develop
- **Release Management**: Clear process for preparing and deploying releases
- **Quality Gates**: Opportunity to run tests and quality checks before merging

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GitHub Flow: Simpler but less suitable for planned releases
- Trunk-based development: Requires more sophisticated CI/CD and feature flags

**Consequences**:
