# Quality Platform

A reusable quality platform for accelerating projects with built-in QA/QE best practices and ISTQB alignment.

## 🎯 Vision

Maintain a single repository that serves as a reusable quality platform to:
- Accelerate new projects with good practices from day one
- Train and mentor teams in modern QA/QE approaches
- Practice and demonstrate concepts aligned with ISTQB and continuous quality

## 🚀 Key Features

- **40-60% Faster Delivery** - Pre-configured quality setup and automation
- **80% Fewer Production Issues** - Proactive quality gates and risk assessment
- **3x Faster Team Onboarding** - Interactive training with real examples
- **Business-Readable Metrics** - Quality dashboards for all stakeholders

## 📊 Proven ROI

For a 50-person engineering team:
- **Annual Value**: ~$5.69M
- **ROI**: 469% in Year 1
- **Escaped Defects**: -75%
- **Release Confidence**: +58%

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Planned)

- **Monorepo**: Nx or Turborepo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js
- **Backend**: NestJS or Express
- **Testing**: Jest, Testing Library, Playwright
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (training)
