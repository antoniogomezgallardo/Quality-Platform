# Quality Platform

A reusable quality platform for accelerating projects with built-in QA/QE best practices and ISTQB alignment.

## üéØ Vision

Maintain a single repository that serves as a reusable quality platform to:

- Accelerate new projects with good practices from day one
- Train and mentor teams in modern QA/QE approaches
- Practice and demonstrate concepts aligned with ISTQB and continuous quality

## üöÄ Key Features

- **40-60% Faster Delivery** - Pre-configured quality setup and automation
- **80% Fewer Production Issues** - Proactive quality gates and risk assessment
- **3x Faster Team Onboarding** - Interactive training with real examples
- **Business-Readable Metrics** - Quality dashboards for all stakeholders

## üìä Proven ROI

For a 50-person engineering team:

- **Annual Value**: ~$5.69M
- **ROI**: 469% in Year 1
- **Escaped Defects**: -75%
- **Release Confidence**: +58%

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Implemented)

- **Monorepo**: Nx Workspace with pnpm
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS with OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport.js (Local + JWT strategies)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Validation**: class-validator with comprehensive DTOs
- **Security**: bcryptjs password hashing, authentication guards
- **Testing**: Jest (unit), Supertest (e2e) - *ready for implementation*
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js - *planned for next phase*
